                        I was born in Poltava in 2002, most time of life has been living in Kyiv. Now, I live in the city of Brno (Czech Republic). Since 7th form I have been writing computer programs. In the 10th form I started working in the IT industry. I finished physics and mathematics high school summa cum laude. I won a few prizes in mathematics, physics and programming at Regional and City Academic Olympic.  Then, for two years I studied at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy majoring in software engineering. Now I study in Masaryk University in Brno, the major is Cybersecurity. During my studies I participated as a programmer in a few student startups.  Overall, I have got 4 years’ worth of experience in commercial software development. My main stack is .NET (C#) + JavaScript. Most of all I worked on web-applications and telegram-bots (Telegram is a popular messenger, on the verge of becoming a social network). I speak Russian and Ukrainian as native tongues, I can read formal documents, specialty manuals and instruction in English at advanced level, though my speaking lags behind for the lack of practice, my Czech is pretty good, at B2 level (I have a certificate from Masaryk University).

                        A few words about myself: I am self-reliant and ambitious. I am a quick learner, and I like learning new technologies. I am flexible and daring, I like non-standard approaches. I am outgoing and sociable, though some of my colleagues peg me as an introvert. Bad habits: I smoke. I do not drink coffee, I love tea, and I drink it in huge quantities.  As a hobby I graduated from a school of music, though majoring in the piano, I play the guitar.  I like rock music, however I listem almost everything. When I am in the mood or hit with an inspiration, I draw graffiti (though only in albums). I love dark themes and black pens. Although I love order in everything, my take on it understand may be somewhat unconventional. I cannot stand the cold.
